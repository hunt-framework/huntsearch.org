        "body": "Toggle navigation Examples About About What is Hayoo Hayoo is a search engine for Hackage packages. It is possible to search for functions, data types and packages. Each indexed document consists of a name, a description and, if applicable, a signature. Have a look at the examples of how to use Hayoo. All available packages are indexed in contrast to Hoogle, although the signature search is not as advances as the one from Hoogle. Hunt Hayoo uses Hunt for indexing and searching. Hunt is a flexible, lightweight search platform with a powerful query language and JSON api. Hayoo exposes the query language through it's interface and thus allows for advanced queries on Hayoo. Additionally, Hunt consists of a stand alone web server to allow integration into existing infrastructures without the need of writing Haskell code. Json api Hayoo exposes a Json api for the usage of other clients. The json api is available under /json . The json api accepts a parameter page to cycle through the pages. Feedback Bug-reports should be submitted to Github , You can also provide Feedback to info@huntsearch.org History The old Hayoo is based on the Holumbus search engine. Hunt is the successor of Holumbus and the new Hayoo is a rewrite on top of the Hunt search engine. Hayoo Frontend © 2014 Sebastian Philipp | Powered by Hunt | Github",
